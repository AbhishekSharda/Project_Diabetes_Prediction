## Project Diabetes Prediction
This project is focused on analyzing diabetes data of the Pima Indian tribe and addressing some important business problems/questions. The aim is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Training using Python.


## Introduction
Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide, and the number of diabetic patients is growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago, research was done on a tribe in America, which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and building a classification Model.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It can be downloaded from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

The dataset contains information about female patients at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. It includes various features like glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, BMI, and age. The target variable is the onset of diabetes within five years of follow-up.
